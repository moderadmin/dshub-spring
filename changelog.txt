* account.LastLogin works now, on both reg info and GUI;
* kickable and renameable works now for all registered users;
* removed variable kick_ops and rename_ops;
* removed variable keep_alive_interval since its not needed anymore;
* made TimeSpent online;
* fixed bugs on cmd line cfg-ing some variables;
* fixed not showing messages about password on login;
* added new static file with time conversions, time will be taken in the following form :
the compatible format is : #xxxw#xxd#xxh#xxm#xxs#xx. where xxx stands for any numbers;
and w= weeks, d days, h hours m minutes, s seconds, . milliseconds.
# is a parsing delimitator. If a number is 0, it can be skipped.
Example : #1w#3h#55m#2s = 1 week , 0 days, 3 hours, 55 minutes 2 seconds and 0 millis.
* updated TimeOnline in the new specifier;
* fixed that users cannot have a CID nick;
* made nickprotected ok, and by default any reg user has its nick protected ( reg advantage);
* also made about command as available by default for new regs.
* account flyable is now available !
Account flyable means that : if account has a password set, the last nick used will be possible to be used to
log in to account, if password is ok. Then, the CID of the new client is being memorized for the account.
To be flyable, the nick must NOT be protected, so when you check flyable, its being auto deactivated.
* added a help panel on GUI commands which describes all commands;
* fixed one bad show up when granting mass command;
* added class comment on each class;
* generated a javadoc for DSHub.
* created basic command spam for CTM and INF;
* moved login commands to STA instead of MSG ( to avoid state early transition)
* fixed adc adv config panel for INF ( forgot about it :D)
* created remembering system for old INF's... to be sent every 2 mins interval;
* modified ctm spamming a bit;
* TAG: ETA;

* fixed creating ugly log file with wrong path & name with startup message;
* modified share to MiB, added extra message to disconnect specifying min share;
* TODO : messages for all disconnects( better ones);
* DSHub has now powerful searching features..
First, we need to make a distinction between the.
automagic and the user searches.
First type is made by client at a regular interval
and DSHub keeps a liniar spam setting.
Second type are user searches ( manual searches )
that the user takes.
For this type (because of the human factor)
DSHub keeps a logarithmic spam setting.
This way, the 2nd search is at search_log_base
interval, but third, is at search_log_base^2
and so on, until the power gets to max_steps.
After this point, the user needs to wait
search_spam_reset seconds to get his burst back.
The searches are being kept in queue ( not ignored !)
and are processed once the timeout is completed
so user doesnt need to search again
but just wait for his search to be completed.
The messages appears as a fictive result
in his search box, which will be filled
once the search string is being sent to others.
* Lots of new stuff, started working on the spam settings on searches;
* above is the main info for the variables i added;
* automagic_search is the automagic interval;
* search_log_base the log base for search spam algorithm;
* search_steps the max steps allowed in log scale;
* search_spam_reset the time needed to reset burst ( also needed if search_steps is touched);
* msg_search_spam the message that appears as a fake result in searches until the SCH is being sent;
* added a hub_security bot that receives cmds in private ( but are shown as IMSGs still );
* also added 2 vars: bot_name and bot_desc to set the NI and DE of the bot;
* added extra fields to clienthandler so it can properly remember chat settings;
* fixed some banning bugs...
* added posibility to delete accounts from GUI via delete key...
* fixed bugs when renaming and not check the bot cid & nick
* added extended possibilites to mass comand, renamed from massall to mass
* hub security now sends all messages except login;
* finally found bug that killed me over last month, when passive user couldnt connect irregulary (found out why);
* completely changed string parsing, now everything is going thru 2 functions;

           * now users cant use an IP for a nick;
           * removed whocid and whoip commands, moved that 
to info       example !info nick gives info about a nick, 
!info cid shows user with cid,  !info ip shows info about users with given ip;
           * big change: default password "defpass" removed, 
now, by default, regs have no pass, just CID check

given commands since startup;
           * added drop command , a kick with no reason
 and 0 ban time;
           *Kick Command:
Kicking in DSHub is very simple now.
Classic kick:
     kicks just a user out in flames, with a kick_time 
temporary ban, default 5 minutes.
Extended kick has way more advantages and can be used 
very efficiently with a large hub.
Extended kick features:
   Kicking users that match a certain regular expression:
      Example: !kick \[RO\].* -- this command kicks all 
users that have their nick starting with [RO]
      Example: !kick .. --this command kicks all users 
with 2 letter nicks
      This type of kick accepts just any regular expression.
   Kicking users that have their fields checked:
      Example: !kick share<1024 --this command just 
kicks all users with share less then 1 gigabyte.
      Example: !kick sl=1 -- this command kicks all users 
with exactly one open slot.
      Example: !kick su!tcp4 -- this command kicks all 
passive users.
Extended kick has the operators >, < , =, !
   And a list of possible fields : share, sl (slots), ni (
nick length),su(supports, accepts only = or !, example: 
!kick su=tcp4),hn(normal hubs count),hr(registered hub 
count),ho(op hub count),aw(away, 1 means normal away, 2 
means extended away),rg (1- registered, 0 otherwise, 
registered means not op),op ( 1 -op, 0 - otherwise , 
op means it has key).
           * created a kick and ban function for easy 
call from commands;
           * done almost all that kick stuff, for share 
slots and su, still need to do for rest;
           * added a debug message, please ignore, or 
if you figure it out, report to me;
           * modified share kick, to be in megabytes;
           * completed kick with all mentioned above 
in the log;
           * fixed bug on new kick, forgot to check 
if kick_ops is enabled;
           * added same features to drop command as well;
           * added extra fields to reg class so OLD 
regs DONT WORK anymore sorry so please REREG;
           * modified reg command, now if user already 
added prints user info;
           * added a getRegInfo method, also added 
extra fields on info and reg;
           * added hideme command that toggles the 
hideme, also hideme is remembered in reg file;
           * fixed bug when restarting and changing 
default port;
           * fixed bug when opchat could have same
 nick as other users;
